# 🔫 Third-Person Shooting Game – Unreal Engine 5.5 (C++)

A Third-Person Shooter developed in **Unreal Engine 5.5** using **C++ and Blueprints**, focused on core gameplay programming, modular systems, and performance optimization.

This project has been built and refined over **4 months**, serving as a deep dive into Unreal Engine’s gameplay architecture, combat systems, and AI behavior. The goal was to implement clean, structured, and scalable C++ systems rather than relying heavily on Blueprints.
